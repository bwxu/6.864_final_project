# 6.864 Project

##Abstract
	
SAT vocabulary questions involve selecting the best word or words out of the choices given to fill in a blank for a block of text.

This project will solve these vocabulary questions by applying the ideas of n-gram models, parsing, and recurrent neural networks in order to correctly rank and identify the best solutions. In particular, we will score each option with our model and select the highest scoring answer as our solution.

##Data/Corpora

To acquire data, we will create a database of past SAT vocabulary questions and solutions. We will also use a database of all SAT vocabulary words and their definitions for our model.

##Baselines

We will use multiple baselines to compare our results, such as random answering and average SAT test scores. We will also compare it to previous similar classifiers.

##Evaluation

To measure the performance of our system, we will analyze the accuracy of our model in answering easy, medium, and hard questions. We will also look at top 2 accuracy, where we check if the answer was one of our top two choices. Another consideration will be the speed of our algorithm and whether it works within a reasonable time span with a reasonable amount of resources.
